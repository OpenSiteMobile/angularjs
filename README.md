Demo's using our MobileSiteOS adaptation of AngularJS

This is a demo and test page repository for our MobileSiteOS adapted version of the AngularJS (https://angularjs.org/). The included examples and demo's illustrate the ability to successfully utilize MobileSiteOS via AngularJS. The MSOS version of AngularJS has been modified to most efficiently integrate the two together. With only minor changes to the standard AngularJS script, you can use our "ng.util.postloader" constroller for lazy-loading MSOS integrated AngularJS modules, if you prefer.

Please note: The MSOS version of AngularJS requires UnderscoreJS, Modernizr and jQuery as "hard dependencies". Thus it is a significant derivation from the standard version. We however, are striving to keep all the original goodness in tact as much as possilbe. If nothing else, it is an attempt at identifying alternative configurations for the original code, and as an educational overview of how AngularJS works.
